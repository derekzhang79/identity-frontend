      The regex used to validate email addresses is based on the one used by WebKit for html email validation
      and comes from here: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#valid-e-mail-address
      However it has the additional constraint that the domain must not be dotless

      There are a few patterns which it doesn't match correctly, but these are the same as all the
      major browsers so do not represent a regression.

      Unsupported valid patterns:
        email@[123.123.123.123] //Square bracket around IP address is considered valid
        "email"@domain.com //Quotes around email is considered valid

      Unsupported Invalid patterns;
        email..email@domain.com //Multiple dots in the first part of the email
        email@domain.web //Invalid top level domains
        email@111.222.333.44444 //Invalid IP format
